            <h2>Photoshop Special Techniques</h2>
            <h3>Photoshop</h3>
            <p>
                Photoshop as a tool can be very useful, and learning how to use it properly was an interesting challenge. I got to experiment a lot with the program, especially with one of our assignments at CART. The assignment given was for us to pick out and complete some Photoshop tutorials that would teach us how to create a certain effect. In total we needed to make at least 4 different images. I ended up doing 8 in total, but the ones that I'm most fond of are displayed below.

                I learned a lot about Photoshop in this project, especially about more of the complex tools. Using the basic effects together allowed me to create more complex looks, but I also needed to learn how to use the color editing tools effectively. Going through some of these tutorials helped me learn how to work not just with Photoshop but with color as well, especially working with RGB and hexadecimal color values that I couldn't understand before. I got a more in depth understanding of the individual settings for each effect and what they do. The experience also helped me learn where settings and tools were in Photoshop menus. My previous projects looked more like stacking random effects on an image semi-randomly until I found something that looked cool, whereas after this project I could open an image and know exactly what I needed to do to achieve a certain effect.

                The biggest challenge in this project was learning where to find assets that could be used freely. I needed to find textures and pictures to use, as well as make a few of my own. One of the tutorials I selected suggested that I make my own texture by taking a piece of paper, scuffing it up and getting it dirty outside on the concrete, then scanning it in color to use on the provided image. I did not have any paper readily available for that, so I needed to find a texture I could use online instead. 
                <br><br>
                I eventually got what I needed, and the end result was one of my favorite images I made for this project. Through collaboration with my nearby classmates we helped each other find assets to use, as well as establish known good sources for them in the future. Collaboration is one the CART habits of mind critical in working on almost any project, even those outside of work/school. Success in this project ended up helping me a lot with other work, especially work which used Photoshop, but also in any work I used RGB or hexadecimal color values for. I'm proud of the skills I learned and demonstrated in this project, and look forward to using them in the future. Unfortunately I can't display the finished files, but I plan on adding them here when I can export them in a format besides .psd.
