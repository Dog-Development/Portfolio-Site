            <h3>Development</h3>
            <p>
                The choose your own adventure game project from CART is one of the projects I had the most fun with. We were separated into pairs for this project, and tasked with creating a compelling story with branching paths and decisions for a player to make. The story must feature every step of the 12 step “hero's journey” We then had to come up with a functional site where a user could experience and interact with that story. Collaborating on this project was a lot of fun since we had a lot of creative freedom.
                <br><br>
                Me and my partner were able to exchange ideas and come up with a very creative story. The freedom for us to design the site to look and feel however we wanted allowed me to make some very interesting features, and I enjoyed implementing those ideas. The site has much more motion than previous sites, and I got much more time learning CSS animations, transitions, keyframes, and other animation methods. I also added sound effects to the page, which allowed me to learn more about embedding media in a page.
                <br><br>
                The biggest challenge for me was in trying to make the interactions for the story work properly. Buttons needed to be uniquely identifiable, which would be used to determine which block of the story that button would lead to if pressed. The buttons also had to be procedurally generated from a JavaScript constant; it was not feasible to write the code for every story button manually. I had no experience with forEach(), the method I needed to use to make the buttons, and learning how to write in its syntax properly was very frustrating. I wanted to give up and just try to reverse engineer someone else's code that served a similar purpose, but I knew that I shouldn't. At CART we were taught some good habits of mind, one of which was being persistent. 
                <br><br>
                Despite the multiple failures in my code, the lack of understanding of how to use the tools I needed, and the lack of information elsewhere on how to use them, I managed to write code that worked. Not only had I written working code, it was shorter than all of the other solutions I had found. I had help, of course, from my partner. Communication, sharing ideas, and encouraging each other to continue to problem solve were all major reasons we were successful, not just in making the JavaScript but in the project as a whole. Reflecting on that success taught me a lot about why it is important to persist despite the urge to give up and find a different, inferior solution. It also taught me about collaboration and how working well with others is critical in accomplishing things that neither collaborator could do alone. Overall the final product came out much better than I originally thought it would, and I'm very proud of it. You can try out our game <a href="https://adventure-game-cyoa.netlify.app">here</a>.
